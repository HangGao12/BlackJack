# BJ Game
HangGao-project

All experiments are based on the environment under python

The current code has not added the part about neural networks

First step: Type the command "pip install numpy". Type the command "pip install matplotlib". (Make sure that the two data packages "numpy" and "matplotlib" are installed on your computer)

If you try to run the interactive domain program, just run the code "bj.py".

If you try to run the computer experiments, just run the code "bj_exp.py".

The format of the code I refer to the "mancala" format in HW2, but the code content is completely different
